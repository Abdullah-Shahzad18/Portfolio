                    <h1>10-Year Outlook:</h1>
                    <p>In the next ten years, I envision myself growing into a well-rounded cybersecurity expert, 
                        deeply involved in safeguarding digital infrastructures and combating cyber threats. 
                        As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity, my goal is to stay at the forefront of this 
                        dynamic field by continuously developing my technical skills in areas like ethical hacking, 
                        threat analysis, and digital forensics. I aspire to work with top organizations, contributing 
                        to securing sensitive data and critical systems, and ultimately aim to lead a team of cybersecurity professionals. 
                        Additionally, I hope to advocate for cybersecurity awareness, empowering individuals and organizations to prioritize 
                        their digital safety in an increasingly connected world.</p>
